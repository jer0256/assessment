## Simple CRUD for ReactJS
This app contains following simple features:
- create a new post
- update a post
- delete a post
- view a single post
- view all posts (with pagination)
- search for posts via keyword, results are paginated.
- sort posts via date created / title
At minimum, a post has a title and content.
Validations must be present (like post title and content should be required.)
Before deleting a post, a confirm modal will be displayed to warn the user, and ask if he/she wants to continue.
